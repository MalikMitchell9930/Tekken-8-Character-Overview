<h2 id="reason-for-making">Reason for making</h2>
<p>The reason I chose to develop this project is that I wanted to expand my knowledge and ability of creating full stack Spring Boot web applications while incorporating something that I really enjoy, which is Tekken. Creating this project has given me valuable skills working with databases, learning more on how to structure and maintain them, also Iâ€™ve been able to practice creating REST APIs and gaining more understanding of them and why they are so useful. Lastly, this project allowed me to learn more about Tekken and its many characters, which is awesome!</p>
